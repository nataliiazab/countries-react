# Country Explorer

Country Explorer is a web application that allows users to explore information about different countries around the world. It provides features such as country search, region-based filtering, and a toggle for light and dark mode.

## Features

- **Search**: Users can search for countries by typing their names in the search bar. The search is case-insensitive and displays real-time results as the user types.

- **Filter by Region**: Users can filter countries by their regions using a dropdown menu. They can select from options like Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania to view countries from a specific region.

- **Light/Dark Mode**: The application offers a dark mode for enhanced readability in low-light environments. Users can switch between light and dark mode using the toggle button in the header.

- **Country Information**: For each country displayed, users can view details such as the country's flag, population, region, and capital.

## Technologies Used

- React: The front-end of the application is built using React, providing a smooth and responsive user interface.

- REST Countries API: Country data is fetched from the "https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all" API, which provides extensive information about countries worldwide.

- CSS: Styling and layout are implemented using CSS, with specific classes for light and dark mode.
